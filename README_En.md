=================

This is the home of the Litone 3D printer

This printer design takes a lot of inspiration from Graber i3 issued from the prusa I3.

Graber i3

The litone is a wooden printer made with hand tools. You do not need any parts 
or printed cnc machine to print the first pieces.

Secondly, you can improve some points with pieces from the machine itself.

The wood is needed 6mm and 15mm meduim. The rooms have been designed to make 
the adjustment easier despite the poor tolerances associated with manual woodworking.

The i3 Graber served as the basis for the design of this printer. The latter is 
itself derived from Prusa i3.

The overall build envelope dimensions remain the same as the Prusa i3, which is
200mm x 200mm x 150mm.

If you find a bug, I welcome notifications, fixes, and even new contributions.

Modifications
